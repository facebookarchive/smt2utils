This project aims to develop Rust libraries and tools around the [SMT-LIB-2
standard](http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/language.shtml).

The SMT-LIB-2 format (SMT2 for short) is the reference input format for many SMT solvers such
as Z3 and CVC4.

## Content

* [smt2parser](smt2parser) is generic parsing library for SMT2 commands.

* [smt2proxy](smt2proxy) is an experimental tool to intercept and pre-process SMT2
  commands before they are sent to an SMT solver.

* [z3tracer](z3tracer) is an experimental library and tool to process Z3 logs obtained by
  passing the options `trace=true proof=true`.

* [smt2patch](smt2patch) is an experimental library and tool to modify SMT files.

* [smt2model](smt2model) is an experimental tool to transform SMT2 files into suitable
  formats for "language modeling" with machine learning.

The code in this repository is still under active development.
