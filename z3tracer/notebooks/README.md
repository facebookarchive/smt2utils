# Example notebooks using z3tracer

* See the documentation of [EVCXR](https://github.com/google/evcxr/blob/master/evcxr_jupyter/README.md)
for detailed instructions on how to install the Rust kernel in Jupyter notebooks.

* Run `jupyter lab z3tracer/notebooks` and open one example file.

* Execute each cell step by step (for instance using SHIFT+RET). NOTE: compiling and loading crates may take some time.

* Examples based on [plotly](https://github.com/igiagkiozis/plotly) may require [additional installation steps](https://igiagkiozis.github.io/plotly/content/fundamentals/jupyter_support.html)
  to make Javascript libraries available to Jupyter notebooks. Eventually, it should look like
  [this](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/facebookincubator/smt2utils/blob/master/z3tracer/notebooks/example_plotly.ipynb).
